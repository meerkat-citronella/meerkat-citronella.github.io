# Introduction

## Browsers are the future!

Google Chrome is now the most popular web browser of all time, and user adoption of Chrome has accelerated over the past several years. Chrome has over 2 billion active users, and it owns 65% of market share with claims from Google of over 2 billion active Chrome browsers in 2016. Chrome is wonderful for a handful of reasons:

1. It looks and runs the same on most computers
2. It's easy to install
3. You can turbocharge Chrome using Extensions.

Regarding point number 3, Chrome extensions are an incredible way for developers to deliver delightful software to users. If you've ever watched a Mr. Beast vidoe, you're probability familiar with [Honey](https://www.joinhoney.com)? Their software is almost entirely based around browser extensions, and Paypal just bought them for **\$4 billion**! [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com), another Chrome extension, recently raised \$90 million and is now valued at over \$**1 billion**! With a great idea and some hard work, perhaps you too can build a unicorn startup in Chrome :)

## Extensions are great, but not simple to build with React

In the year 2020, there are countless JavaScript frameworks that make developing for the web easier than ever. ReactJS happens to be [one of the most in-demand JS frameworks](https://twitter.com/AlexReibman/status/1203047332515926017/photo/1). Unfortunately, Chrome extensions don't work the same as traditional web applications. So, you can't just use create-react-app and expect to build an extension. In this tutorial, we will guide you step-by-step in building your own React-based Chrome Extension.
